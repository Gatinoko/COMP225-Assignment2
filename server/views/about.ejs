          My name is Gabriel Dias Tinoco, I'm currently 19 years old, and currently I'm enrolled in the Software Engineering
          Technology program at Centennial College. <a href="/home">Here's my resume.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm really into technology in general, computers, keyboards, and even sound devices. However, I'm way more experienced when it comes to the software part
          of the process. I used to find the idea of programming very amusing, but ever since college started, I began liking it way more.
